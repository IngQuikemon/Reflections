Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A:At this point, I would use the remote repository option when I am working
in different computers, or when working with other people that could contribute
to my projects.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:So that I can have control of the changes coming from other people to my local
repository and not dealing with unwanted changes being committed on mine.

Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A:Forks are a version of cloning within github that allows to make a copy of an
existing repository on someone else account, and allowing to make changes
without disturbing his repository. Clone would help to make a copy of a current
repository which could affect any commits that would be applied to it. Branches
allows different lines of code to coexist at the same time, and when time is due
, it would be possible to merge when changes demand it or release plans require
it. Based on those descriptions, I would use each one of those accordingly.


Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
A:So that I can do comparisons and do merge accordingly.

Q:How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
A: Probably using another cloud server (like google drive, onedrive or similar).
The challenges would be the revision and log history of what changes have been
committed on the file as well as controlling the changes on the main repository.

Q:When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
A:
